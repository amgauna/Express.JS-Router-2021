<H1>JavaScript Values, Names, and Literals</H1>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF= "#values">Values</A>
<LI><A HREF= "#names">Variable Names</A>
<LI><A HREF= "#literals">Literals</A>
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="values"> <H2>Values</H2></a>

<P>
JavaScript recognizes the following types of values:
<UL>
<LI>numbers, such as 42 or 3.14159
<LI>logical (Boolean) values, either true or false
<LI>strings, such as "Howdy!"
<LI>null, a special keyword denoting a null value
</UL>
<P>
This relatively small set of types of values, or <i>data types</i>, 
enables you to perform useful functions with your applications.  Notice that there
is no explicit distinction between integer and real-valued numbers.  Nor is there
an explicit date data type in Navigator.  However, the date object and related 
built-in functions enable you to handle dates.
<p>
Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures
that your application can perform.

<H3>Datatype Conversion</H3>
<P>
JavaScript is a loosely typed language.  That means that you do not have to specify
the datatype of a variable when you declare it, and datatypes are converted
automatically as needed during the course of script execution.  So, for example, you could define a variable as follows:
<PRE>
var answer = 42
</PRE>
<P>
And later, you could assign the same variable a string value, for example:
<PRE>
answer = "Thanks for all the fish..."
</PRE>
<P>
Because JavaScript is loosely typed, this will not cause an error message.
<P>
In general, in expressions involving numeric and string values, JavaScript converts the numeric values to strings.  
For example, consider the following statements:
<pre>
x = "The answer is " + 42
y = 42 + " is the answer."
</pre>
<P>
The first statement will the string "The answer is 42".  The second statement will return the string "42 is the answer".

<P>
JavaScript provides several special functions for manipulating string and numeric values:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="builtin.htm#eval">eval</A>attempts to evaluate a string representing any JavaScript literals or variables,
converting it to a number.
<LI><A HREF="builtin.htm#parseInt">parseInt</A> converts a string to an integer of the specified radix (base), if possible.
<LI><A HREF="builtin.htm#parseInt">parseFloat</A> converts a string to a floating-point number, if possible.
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="names"> <H2>Variable Names</H2></a>
<P>
You use variables to hold values in your application. You
give these variables <I>names</I> by which you reference them,
and there are certain rules to which the names must conform. 
<P>
A JavaScript identifier or <I>name</I> must start with a letter or
underscore (&quot;_&quot;); subsequent characters can also be
digits (0-9). Letters include the characters &quot;A&quot; through
&quot;Z&quot; (uppercase) and the characters &quot;a&quot; through
&quot;z&quot; (lowercase). 
JavaScript is case-sensitive.
<P>
Some examples of legal names are:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Number_hits</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>temp99</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>_name</CODE> 
</UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="literals"> <H2>Literals</H2></a>

<P>
Literals are the way you represent values in JavaScript.
These are fixed values that you <I>literally</I> provide in your
application source, and are not variables. Examples of literals
include:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>42</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>3.14159</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>&quot;To be or not to be&quot;</CODE> 
</UL>

<H3>Integers</H3>

<P>
Integers can be expressed in decimal (base 10), hexadecimal (base
16), or octal (base 8) format. A decimal integer literal consists
of a sequence of digits (optionally suffixed as described below)
without a leading 0 (zero). 
<P>
An integer can be expressed in octal or hexadecimal rather than
decimal. A leading 0 (zero) on an integer literal means it is
in octal; a leading 0x (or 0X) means hexadecimal. Hexadecimal
integers can include digits (0-9) and the letters a-f and A-F.
Octal integers can include only the digits 0-7.

<H3>Floating Point Literals</H3>

<P>
A floating point literal can have the following parts: a decimal
integer, a decimal point (&quot;.&quot;), a fraction (another
decimal number), an exponent, and a type suffix. The exponent
part is an "e" or "E" followed by an integer, which can be signed (preceded by 
a "+" or "-").
A floating point literal must have at least one digit, plus either
a decimal point or "e" (or "E"). Some examples of floating point literals
are:
<UL>
<LI>3.1415
<LI>-3.1E12
<LI>.1e12
<LI>2E-12
</UL>

<H3>Boolean Literals</H3>

<P>
The boolean type has two literal values: <B>true</B> and <B>false</B>.

<H3>String Literals</H3>
<P>
A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in double
(&quot;) or single (') quotes. A string must be delimited by quotes
of the same type; that is, either both single quotes or double
quotes. The following are examples of string literals:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>&quot;blah&quot;</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>'blah'</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>&quot;1234&quot;</CODE> 
<LI><CODE>&quot;one line \n another line&quot;</CODE> 
</UL>

<H4>Special Characters</H4>
<P>
You can use the following special characters in JavaScript string literals:
<UL>
<LI><B>\b</B> indicates a backspace.
<LI><B>\f</B> indicates a a form feed.
<LI><B>\n</B> indicates a new line character. 
<LI><B>\r</B> indicates a carriage return.
<LI><B>\t</B> indicates a tab character.
</UL>

<H4>Escaping Characters</H4>
<P>
You can insert quotes inside of strings by preceding them by a backslash.
This is known as <i>escaping</i> the quotes.
For example, 
<PRE>
var quote = "<P>He read \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by R.W. Service"
document.write(quote)
</PRE>
<P>
The result of this would be
<SCRIPT>
var quote = "<P>He read \"The Cremation of Sam McGee\" by R.W. Service"
document.write(quote)
</SCRIPT>

</BODY> </HTML>
